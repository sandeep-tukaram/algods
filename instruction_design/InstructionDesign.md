# Instruction design techniques

Algorithms are used to solve problems. And it is in this context that designing algorithm becomes important. Algorithms are made up of instructions and data. This page dwells upon the instruction part of algorithm and design techniques which one can apply. A CPU architecture specifies many instructions - control, math etc. With assembly languges, one works with low level cpu instructions. A high level programming language is a more comfortable space since it provides abstract constructs. This page will deal with higher level languages (HLL) - in fact pseudocode. 

So, how do we structure the instructions? There are techniques discovered and discussed in popular textbooks. 

Common technique for most of the problems.
+ [Recursion/Subproblems approach](recursion.md)


Techniques for Optimization problems
+ [Dynamic programming](dynamicprogramming.md)
+ [Greedy programming](greedy.md)


Randomized algorithm
+ Randomized quicksort -> uses randomization to increase the probably of balanced partition.

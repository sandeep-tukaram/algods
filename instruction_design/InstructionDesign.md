# Instruction design techniques

Algorithms are used to solve problems by manipulating data through a sequence of well-defined instructions. Understanding how to design these instructions is crucial for effective algorithm development. While CPUs provide low-level instructions (arithmetic, control flow, data movement), and assembly languages work directly with these instructions, higher-level programming languages offer more abstract constructs that make algorithm design more intuitive.

We will focus on instruction design patterns in high-level languages and pseudocode, exploring how we can structure instructions to solve problems efficiently.

Common instruction design patterns:
+ [Recursion/Subproblems approach](recursion.md) - Breaking down problems into smaller, similar subproblems. There are many ways to split a problem into subproblems. Divide and conquer is a popular technique.

Optimization-focused patterns:
+ [Dynamic programming](dynamicprogramming.md) - Storing and reusing intermediate results
+ [Greedy programming](greedy.md) - Making locally optimal choices at each step

Probabilistic instruction patterns:
+ Randomized algorithms - Using random choices to improve average-case performance
  - Example: Randomized quicksort - randomizes pivot selection for better partitioning

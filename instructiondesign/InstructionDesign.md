# Instruction design techniques

When I first read books on algorithms, the design aspect of algorithms at best appeared random. Some genius had an eureka moment and voila! It took many repeated readings to realize the underlying techniques.


+ (Recursion/Subproblems approach)[recursion.md]

Techniques applicable to optimization problems
+ (Dynamic programming)[dynamicprogramming.md]
+ (Greedy programming)[greedy.md]


## Randomized algorithm
+ Randomized quicksort -> uses randomization to increase the probably of balanced partition.

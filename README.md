Repository contains notes, code etc related to algo and ds. Purpose is mostly to serve self - to better understand the space. Hope it helps others as well.

## Computational Problems

Problem specifies, in general terms, the relation between the provided input and the expected output. For example, given input a1, a2, ..., an output in sorted order 

Some of the problems found in textbooks:
- Sorting
- Searching
- Optimization
- Graph problems
- String problems
- Computational geometry
- Matrix problems
etc.

## Algorithm Solutions

    Input  -->  Algorithm (computational instructions)  -->  Output

Algorithms are implemented using a programming language. It is compiled into an executable which is then run on a computer. The computer provides the resources - CPU, Memory etc.

                                Algorithm (Program)
    Input  --->         ------------------------------------        --->  Output
                            Computer (CPU, Memory, etc.)


### Efficiency
Algorithm's efficiency is measured in time and space. Less usage of CPU  and memory more efficient the algorithm. Each problem can have multiple algorithm solutions. For example, sorting can be done by bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc. For a given instance, some algorithms are more efficient than others, meaning their usage of CPU and Memory is lesser.

Interestingly one wants to know what's the lower (best case) bound and what's the upper (worst case) bound of resource usage. These are mathematically denoted as Ω (Omega) and O (Big O) respectively. Θ (Theta) indicates both upper and lower bounds.

### Correctness
Correctness of algorithm has to be proven. This is usally done using mathematical tools and reasoning.

## Why MD?
Markdown is suitable for blogging. There are tools that convert md files to web pages.
Don't want to be bothered about HTML and CSS unless required.
Markdown is flexible - can include HTML, and CSS if required.

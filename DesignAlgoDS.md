# Designing Algorithms: Data & Instructions

## Introduction
You know that feeling when you first look at an algorithm textbook? Everything seems like magic, right? Like some genius just had an "aha!" moment and came up with these brilliant solutions. I've been there too, and I bet most of us have. The trouble is, we often end up just memorizing algorithms instead of really understanding the craft. That's not great.

Look, I get it - diving deep into algorithms takes time and patience. Sometimes it feels like everyone else is zooming ahead while you're still figuring things out. That pressure to keep up? Yeah, we've all felt it. But here's the thing: racing through concepts just to "keep up" isn't the way to go.

Recently, I decided to dive deep into textbooks, research papers, and blogs. Sure, there's a risk of "falling behind," but I've made peace with that. This is my way of breaking free from that rat race, even if just a bit. I'll be honest - I'm totally fascinated by this stuff, and I think it's worth the time to really get it.

I hope I can encourage you to do the same while saving lot of time and effort.

## Basics - Computer and Algorithms
Let's keep this simple and straightforward! We're going to break everything down into manageable pieces. And here's the key thing to remember: every algorithm - and I mean every single one - comes down to just two parts: how we store our data, and the operations we perform on it. Let's see how this plays out, starting with the basics and working our way up to tougher problems.

In a simple sentence: an algorithm is just a set of steps working with data solving a problem specification. That's it! Let's look at a super simple example:

```
v1 = 2              # Step 1: Store the value 2 in memory location v1
v2 = 4              # Step 2: Store the value 4 in memory location v2
v1 + v2             # Step 3: Add values from memory locations v1 and v2
```

See what we did there? Even in this tiny example, we can spot our two main parts:
1. Data storage: We're using v1 and v2 to keep our values somewhere. They care called variables.
2. Instructions: We add the variables to obtain the sum.

The two-part pattern shows up everywhere - whether you're adding two numbers or building a complex search algorithm. Pretty neat, right? 

### Computer Model
Let's understand how computers work using an anology - a reading room! And guess what? This perfectly shows our two-part theme in action: we've got a place to store stuff (data storage) and a place to work with it (instructions).

Imagine you're in a reading room with:
1. A desk (this is like the CPU - where we follow instructions)
2. A magical bookshelf (this is like Memory - where we store data)

#### The Magical Bookshelf (Memory)
Think of memory like a bookshelf where:
- Each shelf spot has a name (like "v1" or "temp")
- Each spot holds one book with just one number
- You can instantly grab any book you want
- You never run out of shelf space

You can do two things with this storage space:
```
READ:   Look at the number in a book
WRITE:  Put a new number in a book
```

Pretty simple, right? It's just like having an endless bookshelf where you can grab or store books super quickly! This is our first main part - data storage in action.

#### Your Desk (CPU)
This is where you do all your work - it's the instructions part of our two-part theme:
- You can only work with numbers from books you've taken from the shelf
- All basic calculations take the same time
- You can do simple math and comparisons:
```
MATH:      +, -, ร, รท
COMPARE:   Is A bigger than B?
DECIDE:    If something is true/false
```

Think of it as your personal workspace - but remember, you can only work with what you've grabbed from the shelf! Lets call it workspace model of computer.

### Algorithm - adding two numbers
We can use the workspace model (computer) to come up with an alogrithm to add two numbers:
```
1. Get book from v1    # Data storage: reading from memory
2. Get book from v2    # Data storage: reading again
3. Add the numbers     # Instructions: processing the data
   at your desk
4. Write result in     # Data storage: writing back to memory
   a new book at v3
```

That's really all there is to it! Every algorithm, boils down to these two fundamental operations:
1. Getting and storing data in memory (like our bookshelf)
2. Processing that data with instructions (like our desk work)

The simple model (cpu + memory) is called the RAM (Random Access Machine) model. But hey, don't get hung up on the name. What's important is that every computation from a simple calculator to a complex AI system, is fundamentally a choreography between: organizing data in memory and processing it through CPU instructions. This might seem like an oversimplification right now, but as we continue, we'll apply the two-part perspective repeatedly to break down even the most complex algorithms. Let's keep exploring!

## Designing Techniques - Problems and Algorithms
With our simplfied model of computer and algorithm, let's talk about solving problems. We use computers to solve problems. It is in the context of problem solving that the design aspect of algorithm becomes very important. When we solve a problem, we care about two main things: making sure our solution works (correctness) and that it works well (efficiency).

### The Two-Part Theme (Again!)
Remember our favorite theme? It shows up here too! After an algorithm is composed of two parts - data and instructions. Naturally, designing an algorithm is then confined to the data and the instructions involved. When designing algorithms, we need to think about:

+ [How to structure our Instructions](instruction_design/InstructionDesign.md)
  - The steps our algorithm will follow
  - The logic and flow of our solution
  - The operations we'll perform

+ [How to organize our Data](datastructure/README.md)
  - The way we'll store information
  - The structures we'll use
  - How we'll access what we need

Most of the time, we solve problems in two phases:
1. First Draft: Get a working solution
   - Focus on correctness
   - Don't worry too much about speed
   - Just make it work!

2. Optimization: Make it better, again using the two-part theme
   - Look for ways to speed up our instructions
   - Consider better ways to organize our data
   - Sometimes a complete redesign is worth it

## Summary
Every algorithm - from the simplest to the most complex - is just playing with these two parts:

1. Data Storage & Organization   
   - Where do we keep our values?
   - How do we organize everything? Usually a tradeoff between write and read.

2. Instructions
   - What steps do we take?
   - How do we work with our stored data?
   - What order do we do things in?
   - How do we get rid of redundant instructions?

Once we start seeing algorithms this way, a lot of things get clearer. Working on a tough problem? Break it down into these two parts. Ask yourself:
- How am I storing my data? Could I organize it better?
- What am I doing with that data? Could these steps be more efficient?

That's really all there is to it! No matter how complicated an algorithm might look at first, remember - it's just some instructions working with stored data. Keep this in mind, and you'll start seeing patterns everywhere. Both are easier said than done. But a framework to approach a problem always makes life easier.

## Scope
Just so you know - there's more to computing than just CPU and memory, what we refer to as the two-parts. Reading and writing files, making network calls add extra complexity. But for now, let's stick to our simple model focusing on our two core parts: data storage (memory) and instructions.

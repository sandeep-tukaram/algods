# Designing Algorithms

## 1. Introduction
You know that feeling when you first look at an algorithm textbook? Everything seems like magic, right? Like some genius just had an "aha!" moment and came up with these brilliant solutions. I've been there too, and I bet most of us have. The trouble is, we often end up just memorizing algorithms instead of really understanding them. That's not great.

Look, I get it - taking time to really understand algorithms feels tough. There's this constant pressure to keep up, this feeling that everyone else is racing ahead while you're trying to figure things out. It's that classic rat race mentality, and it's not fun.

But here's the thing: I decided to take a different path. I spent time diving deep into textbooks, research papers, and blogs. Sure, there's a risk of "falling behind," but I've made peace with that. This is my way of breaking free from that rat race, even if just a bit. I'll be honest - I'm totally fascinated by this stuff, and I think it's worth the time to really get it.

I hope I can encourage you to do the same.

## 2. Approach
Let's keep this simple and straightforward! We're going to break everything down into manageable pieces. And here's the key thing to remember: every algorithm - and I mean every single one - comes down to just two parts: how we store our data, and the operations we perform on it. Let's see how this plays out, starting with the basics and working our way up to tougher problems.

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 Simplified View
Want to know the simplest way to think about algorithms? Here it is: an algorithm is just a set of steps working with data. That's it! Let's look at a super simple example:

```
v1 = 2              # Step 1: Store the value 2 in memory location v1
v2 = 4              # Step 2: Store the value 4 in memory location v2
v1 + v2             # Step 3: Add values from memory locations v1 and v2
```

See what we did there? Even in this tiny example, we can spot our two main parts:
1. Data storage: We're using v1 and v2 to keep our values somewhere
2. Instructions: We're doing things with those values (storing them and adding them)

This same pattern shows up everywhere - whether you're adding two numbers or building a complex search algorithm. Pretty neat, right?

### 3.2 Simplified Computer Model
Let's talk about how computers handle our two main parts. We use something called a RAM model - don't worry, it's simpler than it sounds! Think of it as a basic set of rules:
- Every instruction takes the same amount of time
- Getting or saving data takes the same time every time
- We can use as much memory as we need
- All memory is equally fast to access

### 3.3 Basic Operations
So what can our computer actually do? Let's break it down into our two main parts again:

1. Memory Operations (the data storage part):
```
read: grab something from memory
write: put something into memory
```

2. Compute Operations (the instruction part):
```
arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide
logical: and, or, not
comparison: equal to, less than, greater than
```

Want to see how these work together? Here's what happens when we add two numbers:
```
load v1 -> v0       # Data Storage: Grab the first number
add v2, v0 -> v0    # Instruction: Do the math
store v0 -> v3      # Data Storage: Save our answer
```

### 3.4 Algorithm Design Focus
When we're designing algorithms, we're always thinking about our two key parts:
1. How can we make our instructions more efficient?
2. What's the best way to organize our data?

That's why we usually tackle problems in two steps:
1. First, figure out how to solve it (get those instructions right!)
2. Then, make it better (smarter instructions, better data organization)

## 4. Design Techniques
Remember our two-part theme? Here's how we make each part better: 
+ [Instructions](instructiondesign/InstructionDesign.md) - making our steps smarter and faster
+ [Data access](datastructure/README.md) - organizing our data in clever ways

## 5. Scope Note
Just so you know - there's more to computing than just CPU and memory. Things like reading files or making network calls add extra complexity. But for now, let's stick to our simple model focusing on our two core parts: data storage and instructions.

## 6. Summary
You know what? After all we've covered, it really boils down to just two key things. Every algorithm - from the simplest to the most complex - is just playing with these two parts:

1. Data Storage
   Hey, this is just about where we put our stuff! Think about:
   - Where do we keep our values?
   - How do we organize everything?
   - How do we find what we need when we need it?

2. Instructions
   This is the "what do we actually do?" part:
   - What steps do we take?
   - How do we work with our stored data?
   - What order do we do things in?

Here's the cool thing: once you start seeing algorithms this way, a lot of things get clearer. Working on a tough problem? Break it down into these two parts. Ask yourself:
- How am I storing my data? Could I organize it better?
- What am I doing with that data? Could these steps be more efficient?

That's really all there is to it! No matter how complicated an algorithm might look at first, remember - it's just some instructions working with stored data. Keep this in mind, and you'll start seeing patterns everywhere.

# Data Structures 
Data structure is a way to recognize relations between the elements in a input and take advantage of it. It involves a tradeoff, achieving time efficiency for some of the operations while inefficiency for some of the other operations.

there are plenty of data structures 
+ linear - array, linked list, stack, queue
+ hierarchical - heap, tree variants 
+ dictionaries - hashtable, kv maps 
+ graphs 
etc.
